**Pilot Study**: A smaller, sample dataset is used to test and train a prototype CNN model.

**Principal Study**: The model is trained for enhanced accuracy and generalisation using a comprehensive dataset with over 27,000 images of various skin conditions.

# Project Structure
**Data Preprocessing**: This section covers data cleansing, resizing, and augmentation techniques.
**Model Architecture**: A CNN model is created using Keras.
**Training**: Dataset used for training including details on batch size, learning rate, and epochs.
**Evaluation**: The modelâ€™s performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Confusion matrices and visualizations of model predictions are also included.
